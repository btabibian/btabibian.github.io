This was the time I had the chance to start reading a book “Protocol Politics” by Laura Denardis published by MIT Press. </font></font>

It is made up of protocols that as computer scientists you have definitely heard about them, protocols such as TCP/IP or OSI.</font></font></span></p></div><div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font face="arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">As the number of available IP addresses are being exhausted and number of active on-line Internet users growing exponentially, a new protocol was required and this process clearly showed that protocols play and important role on the Internet, it is the time that many(including myself, showed how nice Internet is managed). </font></font><span><font face="arial,sans-serif"><font size="2"> </font></font></span></span></div><div>
<p style="line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font face="arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Process of adopting IPng (IP next generation) took almost 10 years with several challenges, even though it is formally announced as IPv6 in 1994 it has not yet been adopted and utilized widely, the most important reason is the backward incompatibility. However the process of selecting this process raised many debates over who is governing Internet but it demonstrated the fact that there are still hoped to have a free Iternet.</font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font face="arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">I will continue this discuss in more details later as I continue reading this book. my later texts will come with my very own (probably simple) questions.</font></font></span></p></div>
