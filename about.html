    My name is Behzad Tabibian, I was a CS student at University of Edinburgh and graduated in June 2012 and completed my masters at university of Pittsburgh. I am now doing my PhD at Max Planck Inst, Emperical inference department with Bernhard Scholkopf and Michael Hirsch. My main area research interests are Machine Learning, Statistics and Computer Vision.
</p>
      <p>
I also worked at Amazon as Machine Learning Scientists intern during the summer of 2012 and 2013. The first internship was in Seattle and the second one in Berlin. I worked with forecasting team to test and develop large scale learning systems.
</p>
My CV can be found here.
<p>
I did my undergraduate final project under supervision of Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy titled "Games Robots Play".
<br>
I am also a long time participant of RoboCup competitions. I have been mostly involved with Virtual Robot competitions and member of technical committee member of these competitions. Also I have been involved with Edinferno, University of Edinburgh RoboCup team in Standard Platform league.
</p>

Some of the Courses I took:
      
Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning under Prof. Chris Williams. [A]
<br>  
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition under Dr. Amos Storkey. [A]
<br>  
Reinforcement Learning under Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy. [A]
<br>  
Advanced Vision under Prof. Robert Fisher. [B+]
<br>
I also had Statistical Machine Learning course with Prof. Larry Wasserman and Aarti Singh at CMU in the previous Fall which I finished aith A+.
</p>
Previously I did some work at Iran University of Science and Technology before transferring to University of Edinburgh with Dr. Alireza Mohammad Shahri at Electronic Research Center mostly focused on control algorithms for wheeled mobile robots.

I do various things in my free time, mostly reading classic books in the field of Robotics, computer science, philosophy and philosophy of knowledge and swimming.
