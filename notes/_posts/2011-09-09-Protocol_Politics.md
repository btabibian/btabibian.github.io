Discussion about Internet has many aspects, from the idea of its founders to technical aspects and graph theories, math etc. While the functionality and ease of access which this latest technology provides the human kind always interests me and in my point of view, it will be the definite answer to many serious problems of human beings, but one aspect of this technology makes me astonishingly interested that how this technology is governed and why it has not yet been disappeared by major corporations, or even governments could not yet touch the functionality as a whole, even those which have strong feeling that the available liberty on the cloud is not suitable for their people(or probably themselves). This was the time I had the chance to start reading a book “Protocol Politics” by Laura Denardis published by MIT Press.

Internet as a technology I think, has a very different nature from any other technology invented by human beings since it is not formed by any kind of specific real and sensible work such as software coding or hardware design. It is made up of protocols that as computer scientists you have definitely heard about them, protocols such as TCP/IP or OSI.

As the number of available IP addresses are being exhausted and number of active on-line Internet users growing exponentially, a new protocol was required and this process clearly showed that protocols play and important role on the Internet, it is the time that many(including myself, showed how nice Internet is managed).

Process of adopting IPng (IP next generation) took almost 10 years with several challenges, even though it is formally announced as IPv6 in 1994 it has not yet been adopted and utilized widely, the most important reason is the backward incompatibility. However the process of selecting this process raised many debates over who is governing Internet but it demonstrated the fact that there are still hoped to have a free Iternet.

I will continue this discuss in more details later as I continue reading this book. my later texts will come with my very own (probably simple) questions.
