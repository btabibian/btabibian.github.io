I recieved a couple of remarks from <a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/~arnoud/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arnoud Visser</a> from <a href="http://www.uva.nl/start.cfm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Universiteit van Amsterdam</a>:</div><div><div dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">with small remarks:</font></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div class="sites-codeblock sites-codesnippet-block"><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><span style="color:rgb(0,96,0);font-family:monospace;line-height:12px;font-size:small">Claiming that the SPL is the most important league will upset other leagues.
