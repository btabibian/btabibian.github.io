want to draw a picture of the past with all of its details. I am about to tell
a short story about the first time I wrote a piece of program. For that I should
go back to more than a decade ago. At a time when there were no Internet, not
many books and no geek around you to learn from.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>I still remember the first computer I worked with, if you
are expecting me to give models or details I am not, the concept of computer
itself was so new to me that I never cared what kind or model it is, it was a
computer that's enough to be fantastic. I was in the last year of elementary
school when a new computer with brand new MS Windows 98 came into my father's
office and I used to spend a lot of time playing with it, typing, playing a few
games installed on it and most importantly "discovering" how it works.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took me another 2 years until I realized I need to understand
how computer software works. In the mean time I heard from some people about “Programming
Languages” specially one which is called <i>Baisc.</i>I remember I was a guest
somewhere when I saw how Basic environment looks like and it was really boring to
me, it was not at all like those beautiful graphics in Windows and I told
myself this is not what I am looking for. Then I heard about another thing
called “Algorithms” that was even more boring. My mother put me in an Algorithm
class in summer of 1998 which I had no clue what the teacher was talking about
and there were all these older people looking strangely at me asking what this
kid is doing here and honestly I was asking the same question myself. I couldn’t
grasp the idea of algorithms back then and what really are concepts such as
variables, I can remember one time I had a big argument with my sister, who was
not in computers at all but had the course at high school, when she was trying
to teach me Pascal and I still could not understand. Time passed and the more I
tried the less I could understand how to write a program in Basic or Pascal. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Finally I could get a copy of Microsoft Visual Basic
installed on a machine in our home. It finally had the basic ingredients of
what I was looking for, the first thing you could see was a “window”, something
I could easily relate to but the problem was that no one knew how to work with
it, I got a book about Visual Basic but still the problem was that I could not understand
it. I remember I used to sleep with the book and try to read it any time I
could. I went through the first 30 pages of it for many times and tried to understand
what passages mean. But all the attempts were in vein and there seemed to be
no chance for me to get the idea by myself and this book. Nowadays, this looks
very strange but I had no access to any other resources or any other person to
teach me basics of how to program, one of the things that are starting to fade
away in this decade are experiences like this where you have no other way but
to learn things all by yourself rather than asking Google or Wikipedia. I still
remember how frustrated I was but I could not just give up.</p><div style="display:block;text-align:left"><br/></div>

<p>In the middle of the exams in March of 1999 I remember I was
leaning on the wall trying to study for sociology exam and suddenly I felt I
could understand what those beginning passages of the book mean just like a
click in mind, I throw the sociology book away and went to the </p><img border="0" height="250" src="https://sites.google.com/site/btabibian/_/rsrc/1331691189647/notes/howcomputersaidmynameisbehzad/Visual-Basic-Tutorial-screen3.JPG" style="display:inline;float:right;margin-top:5px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:10px" width="320"/><p>computer were
Visual Basic was open on the screen as usual and the book open near the
keyboards and started writing the sample program again but this time made some
changes <i>by myself. </i>I still remember the interface with two buttons and
that one wrote “Hello World!” and the other “My name is Behzad”. That was an
amazing moment for me where I could finally unlock what to me looked impossible
to open. You can imagine those situations with doors that when opened light
comes into the room everything becomes clear and of course that moment was when
I was studying sociology!</p>
<p>After that I spent another 3 hours implementing all the
examples in first few sections of the book and wrote my first program which was
a date convertor from Persian calendar to Christian calendar.</p>
<p>Time passed since that moment and I remember so many other times
felt the <i>click</i> in my mind where I was trying to figure out how something
works and I could not and still there were no Internet or “Stack over flow”,
for those who know what it is, to answer my questions. I had to figure out
everything all by myself. After more than a decade I would say I had no better experience
in my life than that first time when I could truly understand what I was doing.
Things have been going since then but that moment was so special that I try to
celebrate every year around this time. For many Iranians this time of the year
is new-year and things start afresh but for me it all started a few weeks
earlier when I could make the computer say “My name is Behzad”.</p>
