Human rights and freedom
of speech are one of the corner-stones of Internet technology. Within last few decades a huge progress has been made in technology, enabling people from all over
the world to communicate through safe and secure channels. However, unfortunately
this technology has not yet been able to address all of the security and
personal privacy concerns expected by its users. One of the most unsatisfying
results of this issue is the behavior which some companies demonstrate by
banning citizens of certain countries from their services. Most of these
companies disable many features of their services by using techniques known in
the field of computer science as Anti-Features in conjunction with the
limitations of today’s technology.

Mechanics of their
approach is to use IP address (Internet Protocol Address, an address which makes It
possible to transfer a message from one location in a network of connected
devices to another location in that network) of customers to decide which
services must be disabled.

This is indeed in obvious contradiction with
the fundamental philosophy of privacy and protection in design of Internet
Protocol. Users must not be judged by their IP addresses by any means. These
companies have been practicing such behaviors for a long time trying to inspect
their customers identity based on the IP address which they use to connect to
the Internet. One might think that it’s the right of a company to use this
defect of IP technology to identify those who should not use certain features,
but in this logic a fundamental problem which is the fact that users’ identity is
inspected using IP addresses, is neglected.

It is important to note
that principal idea beneath today's Internet technology is liberty
and everyone living in this society must respect this fundamental philosophy.
Unfortunately, we still find many countries attempting to limit liberty of
their citizens by different kinds of filtering mechanisms. This is even more
disastrous when many well-known IT companies also take the same approach
and limit their services for users across the world on the basis of which
address a user uses to connect to the network. Companies like Apple and Google
not only must avoid such behaviors but also must push others to obey
and respect the liberty that technology provides for human kind.</font></p>
I would also like to
point out another recent development in the field of
Internet technology which will hopefully provide more personal
privacy. IPv6 which probably is the next successor of IPv4 has many
features to better protect users’ privacy.

The Privacy Design choices
for IPv6 are well described in the book "Protocol Politics" by Laura DeNardls. It
is important to note that however, the problem is not yet eliminated in IPv6
and therefore an action is required to call all members of the Internet
society (including companies and governments) to avoid such practices which compromise
users’ privacy.
