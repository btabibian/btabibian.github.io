I am Behzad Tabibian, PhD student at Max Planck Institute, Emperical Inference department. I studied Computer Science at University of Edinburgh and obtained my Masters at University of Pittsburgh. My main research interests are Machine Learning and Statistics and their applications in Networks.
<br/>
I also completed two internships at Amazon as Machine Learning Scientist during summers of 2013 and 2014 in Seattle and Berlin. During both internships I worked with forecasting team to test and develop large scale learning systems.

<br/>

I completed my undergraduate final project under supervision of Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy titled "Games Robots Play". The objective of this project was to develop signaling primitives which are based on principles of Game Theory.

I was a long time participant of RoboCup competitions. I have been mostly involved with Virtual Robot competitions both as participant and technical committe member. During my final year at Edinburgh I was also a member of Edinferno, University of Edinburgh RoboCup team in Standard Platform league.
<br>
I had the great privilege of taking courses with some of the world's renowned scientists:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning with Prof. Chris Williams.</li>
<li>Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition with Dr. Amos Storkey.</li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning with Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy.</li>
<li>Advanced Vision with Prof. Robert Fisher.</li>
<li>Statistical Machine Learning course with Prof. Larry Wasserman and Aarti Singh.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Previously I did some work at Iran University of Science and Technology before transferring to University of Edinburgh with Dr. Alireza Mohammad Shahri at Electronic Research Center mostly focused on control algorithms for wheeled mobile robots.


<br/>
I do various things in my free time, mostly reading classic books in the field of Robotics, computer science, philosophy and philosophy of knowledge and swimming.</p>
