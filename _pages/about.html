<p>
I am Behzad Tabibian, PhD student at Max Planck Institute, Emperical Inference department. I studied Computer Science at University of Edinburgh and obtained my Masters at University of Pittsburgh. My main research interests are Machine Learning and Statistics and their applications in Networks.
</p>
<p>
I also completed two internships at Amazon.com as Machine Learning Scientist during summers of 2013 and 2014 in Seattle and Berlin. During both internships I worked with forecasting team to test and develop large scale learning systems.
</p>
<p>
I completed my undergraduate final project under supervision of Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy. The objective of <i>Games Robots Play</i> was to develop signaling primitives that are based on principles of Game Theory for coordination of heterogeneous robots.

<p>
Before 2010 I worked on research projects at Iran University of Science and Technology just before transferring my studies to University of Edinburgh. I mainly collaborated with Dr. Alireza Mohammad Shahri at Electronic Research Center developing control algorithms for mobile robots.
</p>
<p>
I had the great privilege of taking courses with some of the world's renowned scientists:
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning with Prof. Chris Williams.</li>
<li>Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition with Dr. Amos Storkey.</li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning with Dr. Subramanian Ramamoorthy.</li>
<li>Advanced Vision with Prof. Robert Fisher.</li>
<li>Statistical Machine Learning with Prof. Larry Wasserman and Aarti Singh.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I mostly read books in my free time; you can find a list of my favorite books on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10916404-behzad" target="_blank">Good Reads</a> and some of my favorite quotes (hidden) here in this website.
